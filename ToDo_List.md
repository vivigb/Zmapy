# Zmapy0.1
An initiation for developing a python clone for ZMAP 
(http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/research-and-teaching/products-software/software/ZMAP/ )

Why you should use Zmapy (Other than the fact that Python is FREE)
1. Zmapy will be based on the pandas library to keep the catalog operations simple and readable.
2. *.CSV formatted catalog input.
3. Combining multiple catalogs by removing duplicate events by user defined conditions.
4. Publishable quality figures.
5. Saving figures along with the corresponding data (Optional).
6. Always keep the input catalog format (Thanks to pandas)
